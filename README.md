# dinodeck
A simple game engine with goals of rapid development and easy distribution.

[Find out more about Dinodeck at the website](http://dinodeck.com/).

## Status

This repository will hold the dinodeck source code. There's some clean-up that needs doing before it's ready to upload (I renamed the project, the build scripts need making more sane etc).

## Goals

These are the goals that Dinodeck aspires to.

1. **Easy to Play** - users should be able to play a game in Dinodeck by doubling clicking on it. No needing to install drivers, find .dll files etc.

2. **Easy to Create** - developers should be able to rapidly develop games. No waiting on compilers, no having to relaunch the game for each change. The game should be editable in real-time.
